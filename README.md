# CS110
Contains 1st project for CS110 - rotational-N cipher encryption algorithm

Hi! This is where I planned to keep all my projects for my Java class, except I forgot this existed and created a whole repository for my second project.
This repository, however, still contains my very first project--the Rot-N cipher algorithm. This project is a basic encryption algorithm that utilizes a 
rotational-N cipher, in which an arbitrary number N is chosen by the user and used to shift the user's next input by N amount of spaces in the ASCII table 
of characters. Pretty simple, but pretty neat.

This is my first project ever coded in Java, so don't expect it to work perfectly (or at all) on your system.
